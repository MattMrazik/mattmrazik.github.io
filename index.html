                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    Hi! I'm a Massachusetts-based game developer looking to join a team on a full-time basis. Most of my current experience is working with Unity but I am eager to learn new tools and skills. I also have a master's degree in Computer Science from UMass Dartmouth and a minor in Computer Game Design.

                <h3>Blocky Golf</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm currently working on a freelance basis with the upcoming social media startup Genies! Genies will center around user-created avatars and each player will have an inventory and an assortment of traits that they carry with them throughout different games and experiences.

                <p>
                    Blocky Golf (title pending) is a mobile mini-golf game aimed at the casual market. I am developing this project by myself and I own the full rights to this project. This will be my first project to be fully polished and published for a general audience. Guidance for this project has been provided by Genies employees including industry veterans such as games studio director Andrew Chambers.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The game is set to launch August 2024 through the Genies Party app!

                <p>
                    Feel the Rhythm was my Master's Thesis project. It's a blind-accessible rhythm game prototype. Alongside the game itself, I wrote a lengthy thesis on the state of accessibility in the games industry and where my project fits in.

                <p>
                    I am happy to share that my written thesis has been edited into a case study format and accepted for publication at the ACM journal for Games: Research and Practice.

                <p>
                    I recently completed a 9-month temporary contract with Warner Bros. Games Boston working on Game of Thrones: Conquest. I worked on clientside features in Unity and C#.

                <p>
                    I joined the team post-launch and it was great experience for me to get comfortable working in an existing codebase. I started with small maintenance issues and bugs but eventually was able to work on new game mechanics and user-facing content for the game!
